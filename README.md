I took the Udacity Intro Intro Machine Learning Course. However, the course materials all use Python2, which I found inconvenient. For general purposes, you can convert a Py2 file into Py3 by putting `$ 2to3 -w example.py` in the command line. However, many sklearn syntax have also changed. So a simple a command line won't do the job here. 

I have updated all the course related projects with my answering codes inlcuded. They are compatible with Python3. My Python version is 3.7.6.
